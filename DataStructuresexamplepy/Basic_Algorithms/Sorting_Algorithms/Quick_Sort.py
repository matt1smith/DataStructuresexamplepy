##We established a base case where the algorithm will complete when the start and end pointers indicate a list with one or zero elements

##If we haven’t hit the base case, we randomly selected an element as the pivot and swapped it to the end of the list

##We then iterate through that list and track all the “lesser than” elements by swapping them with the iteration index and incrementing a lesser_than_pointer.

##Once we’ve iterated through the list, we swap the pivot element with the element located at lesser_than_pointer.

##With the list partitioned into two sub-lists, we repeat the process on both halves until base cases are met.
